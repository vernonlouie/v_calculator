# Calculator
This app does what a basic calculator does and a few more things.

## Features
a) basic operations (addtion, subtraction, division, multipliation)

b) comprehensive operations (successive, decimals, multiple decimals, multiple operation, changing operation, operation repeat, operation rollover, successive multi operation, division by zero)

c) advanced operations 1 (premature operation, partial operand, missing operation, missing operand)

d) advanced operations 2 (order of operations, parentheses, negative numbers)

## Planned/Possible Additions
1) correct known bugs:

	a) negative with open parenthesis.  e.g. -(8+4)=
	
	b) division by positive decimal number between 0 and 1.  e.g. 52/0.344=
2) memory function - place answer into memory and recall when needed
3) programming this later as a state machine

## What I Learned
- Code that is repeated should be moved into a function and called as a function.  This minimizes code length and makes for easier reading.
- I have a much better understanding of the sequencing of if - else if conditional statements.
- How to access properties of an object.
- How to manipulate an array and array operations.
- How to increment a "for loop" nontraditionally.
- Using a flex box.
- Programming calculators is not easy, especially when accounting for user errors.
